=== EXAMPLE INPUT FOR EXPANSION PIPELINE ===

Use this template when you want to GENERATE prose from an idea.

===================================

## Input (Your Idea)

[Describe your idea - can be loose, conceptual, or structured]

Examples:

LOOSE IDEA:
"Write about returning to grandmother's house after she dies and realizing the place isn't home anymore—she was."

PLOT POINT:
"Scene where character finally tells their mother the truth about why they left home years ago."

JOURNAL THOUGHT:
"I've been avoiding thinking about my childhood home. My parents sold it last year. I drove by last week but didn't stop. Thinking about what it means to lose a place that shaped you."

CONCEPT:
"The moment when freedom becomes overwhelming—first day after leaving a restrictive situation, not knowing what to do with yourself."

===================================

## Mode

[Choose one: FULL / FROM_BEATS / ITERATIVE]

FULL
(Idea Expander creates beats, then Prose Generator creates prose)

===================================

## Context (Optional)

[What is this? Scene, journal entry, essay, chapter?]

This is a scene from a novel about loss and memory.

===================================

## Voice Preferences (Optional)

[POV? Tense? Style notes?]

- First person
- Past tense
- Close, intimate voice

===================================

## Target Length (Optional)

[How long should the prose be?]

- Brief scene (300-500 words)
- Full scene (800-1200 words)  ← Most common
- Longer piece (1500-2000 words)

===================================

## Must-Include (Optional)

[Specific images, moments, or elements that must appear]

- The key under the third stone
- Her mending basket with unfinished work
- The smell of stale bread (vs. fresh bread she used to make)

===================================

That's it! The Expansion Pipeline will:
1. Convert your idea into structured beats
2. Generate Le Guin-quality prose from those beats
3. Optionally refine if you request it

Expected outcome:
- Beats showing emotional arc (5-10 beats typical)
- Draft prose (800-1200 words typical)
- Prose that already shows (doesn't tell)
- Option to refine further

===================================

WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE:

[name]_beats.md
- Structured beats
- Emotional arc identified
- Key images noted
- Sensory anchors specified

[name]_draft.md
- Generated prose
- Le Guin principles applied
- Ready to use or refine

===================================

NEXT STEPS AFTER GENERATION:

1. ACCEPT AS-IS
   → Use the draft prose
   → Manual revision if desired

2. REFINE
   → Run through Refinement Pipeline
   → Get compressed, polished version + quality review

3. ITERATE ON BEATS
   → Review beats, request changes
   → Regenerate with improved beats

4. GENERATE VARIATIONS
   → Try different beat structures
   → Compare multiple versions
