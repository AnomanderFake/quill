# Workflow: Expand Then Refine

Complete pipeline from idea to polished prose.

---

## When to Use

- Important work (publication, portfolio)
- Want Le Guin-level quality immediately
- Don't want to revise manually
- Learning complete process

---

## Process

```
Your Idea
    ↓
Expansion Pipeline
  • Idea Expander (beats)
  • Prose Generator (draft)
    ↓
Refinement Pipeline
  • Prose Refiner (polish)
  • Quality Reviewer (assess)
    ↓
Polished Prose + Review → You
```

**Time:** Full pipeline (both stages)
**Output:** Beats + Draft + Refined + Review

---

## The Journey

### Phase 1: Expansion (15-30 min)
Idea → Beats → Draft prose (800-1200 words)

### Phase 2: Refinement (10-20 min)
Draft → Polish → Review (600-900 words final)

### Total Time
25-50 minutes from idea to finished prose

---

## Step by Step

### 1. Start with Idea

Provide to Master Orchestrator:
```
## Input
[Your idea - can be loose]

## What I Want
Generate prose then refine to publication quality

## Context (optional)
[Type, POV, etc.]
```

### 2. Expansion Runs

**Idea Expander** creates structured beats
**Prose Generator** creates draft prose

**You receive:** Beats + Draft

### 3. Review Draft

Quick check: Does this match your vision?
- **Yes** → Continue to refinement
- **No** → Iterate on beats, regenerate

### 4. Refinement Runs

**Prose Refiner** polishes the draft
**Quality Reviewer** assesses quality

**You receive:** Refined prose + Review

### 5. Review Quality Scores

**Mostly ACCEPTABLE/STRONG?**
→ Done! Use the refined prose

**Some WEAK scores?**
→ Optional second refinement pass

## Example: Complete Journey

**Input:**
"Write about returning to grandmother's house after she dies"

**Expansion Output:**
- 7 beats identified
- Draft: 880 words

**Refinement Output:**
- Refined: 640 words (-27%)
- Scores: 8/10 ACCEPTABLE, 2/10 STRONG
- Verdict: ACCEPTABLE

**Final Deliverables:**
- `grandmother_beats.md`
- `grandmother_draft.md`
- `grandmother_refined.md`
- `grandmother_review.md`

**Progression visible:** Idea → Structure → Draft → Polish

## Advantages

✓ Hands-off (full automation)
✓ Publication-ready output
✓ Learning tool (see full process)
✓ Quality guaranteed (reviewed)

---

## When to Use This

**Use expand-then-refine when:**
- Stakes are high (will be published/shared)
- You want best quality
- You trust the pipeline
- You want to save revision time

**Use expansion-only when:**
- Just drafting quickly
- Will revise manually anyway
- Experimenting with ideas

---

## Files You'll Receive

```
[name]_beats.md          # Structured beats
[name]_draft.md          # Generated prose
[name]_refined.md        # Polished prose
[name]_review.md         # Quality assessment
```

**Complete audit trail from idea to finish.**

---

## Tips

**Trust the process:**
- Let expansion create structure
- Let refinement compress
- Review the scores objectively

**When to intervene:**
- If beats don't match vision (iterate before generating)
- If quality scores show FAIL (second pass needed)
- If you want different voice/style (provide guidance)
