# Depth Expansion Workflow

**Use when:** Already-refined prose needs enrichment, not compression

---

## Overview

This workflow takes **already-refined prose** and adds **15-25% depth** through strategic enrichment while maintaining Le Guin-level craft quality.

**Different from:**
- **Refinement:** Compresses and tightens (typically -20-40%)
- **Expansion Pipeline:** Generates new prose from ideas (800-1200 words)
- **Depth Expansion:** Enriches existing prose (+15-25%)

---

## The Flow

```
Already-refined prose (700 words)
    ↓
Depth Expander
(adds strategic sensory/emotional depth)
    ↓
Enriched prose (850 words, +20%)
    ↓
Quality Reviewer
(verifies quality maintained)
    ↓
Final enriched prose + review
```

---

## When to Use This Workflow

### ✓ Use Depth Expansion When:

- **Refined prose feels skeletal** - Craft is right, but it's too bare
- **Emotional peaks need space** - Moments that deserve to breathe longer
- **Transitions feel abrupt** - Need smoothing between sections
- **Key images could deepen** - One more sensory layer would help
- **Quality reviewer noted "thin"** - Identified spots needing enrichment
- **For publication** - Final work needs richness, not just economy

### ✗ Don't Use Depth Expansion When:

- **Prose is unrefined** - Run refinement first, then expand if needed
- **Economy is the goal** - Flash fiction, compression exercises
- **Brevity has power** - Some moments gain from compression
- **Already well-balanced** - Don't expand what's working perfectly

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Input

**You need:** Already-refined prose that meets Le Guin standards

If you have raw prose:
```
Raw prose
    ↓
Refinement Pipeline FIRST
    ↓
Then depth expansion
```

**Ideal input:**
- 500-2000 words of refined prose
- Passes Le Guin quality checks
- Feels too compressed or thin

### Step 2: Identify Thin Spots (Optional)

Before invoking Depth Expander, note areas that could use enrichment:
- Emotional peaks that rush past
- Dialogue missing physical beats
- Transitions that jar
- Key moments needing grounding

**Or:** Let the Depth Expander identify strategic points automatically

### Step 3: Run Depth Expansion

Invoke the Refinement Coordinator with:

```
## Text to Process
[Your refined prose]

## Pipeline Mode
EXPAND_DEPTH

## Target Areas (Optional)
[Specific moments to enrich, or "identify strategic points"]

## Target Growth (Optional)
[15%, 20%, or 25% - default is 15-25% automatic]
```

### Step 4: Review Results

You'll receive:

1. **Enriched prose** - 15-25% longer than input
2. **Expansion notes** - What was added and why
3. **Word count stats** - Before/after
4. **Quality review** - Verification that craft maintained

### Step 5: Decide Next Step

- **Accept enrichment** - If balance feels right
- **Selective restoration** - If any additions feel wrong, restore originals
- **Further enrichment** - If still too thin (rare - typically one pass is enough)

## Examples

### Example 1: Emotional Peak Enrichment

**Refined Input (50 words):**
> "The valley was behind him. The ship was moving. He didn't look back. Where were they going? He didn't know. His mother's hands, always moving. Kneading bread, pulling weeds, mending nets. She hadn't asked him to stay."

**Enriched Output (65 words, +30%):**
> "The valley was behind him. The ship was moving—deck shifting under his feet, salt spray on his face. He didn't look back. Where were they going? He didn't know. His mother's hands, always moving. Kneading bread at dawn, pulling weeds in afternoon heat, mending nets by firelight. She hadn't asked him to stay. Hadn't asked him to go."

**What was added:**
- Physical sensations (deck shifting, spray, feet)
- Time markers (dawn, afternoon, firelight)
- Parallel structure deepened (hadn't asked to stay/go)
- +15 words in strategic spots

---

### Example 2: Dialogue Beat Addition

**Refined Input (40 words):**
> "Do you want to go?" she asked.
> "I don't know."
> "You have to decide."
> "How many ships leave each year?"
> "Enough," she said.

**Enriched Output (52 words, +30%):**
> "Do you want to go?" she asked.
> He was counting stitches in the net. Not looking at her.
> "I don't know."
> "You have to decide." Her needle paused.
> "How many ships leave each year?"
> She pulled the thread tight. "Enough."

**What was added:**
- Physical actions during dialogue (counting, needle pause, thread pull)
- Shows tension without stating it
- +12 words

---

### Example 3: Transition Smoothing

**Refined Input (35 words):**
> "Morning came. Ren stood at the headland. The ships moved like white birds on gray water. Three years since his father left."

**Enriched Output (48 words, +37%):**
> "Morning came gray and cold. Ren stood at the headland, wind at his back. The ships moved like white birds on gray water. Distant. Unreachable. Three years since his father left. Three years of watching."

**What was added:**
- Weather detail (gray, cold, wind)
- Physical position (wind at back)
- Image deepening (distant, unreachable)
- Time echo (three years of watching)
- +13 words

## Combined Workflows

### Workflow A: Refine → Expand Depth

**For:** Raw prose that needs both compression and enrichment

```
Raw prose (1000 words, verbose)
    ↓
Refinement Pipeline (compress to craft)
    ↓
Refined prose (650 words, -35%)
    ↓
Depth Expansion (strategic enrichment)
    ↓
Enriched prose (800 words, +23% from refined)
    ↓
Final: 800 words (20% compression from original, higher quality)
```

### Workflow B: Refine → Review → Expand Thin Spots

**For:** Refined prose where reviewer identified specific thin areas

```
Raw prose
    ↓
Refinement Pipeline
    ↓
Quality Reviewer (identifies: "Lines 45-52 could breathe more")
    ↓
Depth Expansion targeting Lines 45-52
    ↓
Light polish pass
    ↓
Final review
```

### Workflow C: Iterative Depth Building

**For:** Important work requiring perfect balance

```
Raw prose
    ↓
Refinement (first pass)
    ↓
Depth Expansion (+20%)
    ↓
Light refinement (clean up additions)
    ↓
Review (assess balance)
    ↓
Targeted depth in weak spots
    ↓
Final review
```

## Quality Checks

After depth expansion, verify:

### ✓ Quality Maintained:
- [ ] No thought-reporting reintroduced
- [ ] No emotion labeling added
- [ ] All additions are concrete/physical
- [ ] Dialogue still weighted
- [ ] POV consistency maintained
- [ ] Show-not-tell preserved

### ✓ Depth Achieved:
- [ ] Growth is 15-25% (not <10% or >30%)
- [ ] Emotional peaks have more space
- [ ] Key moments breathe more
- [ ] Transitions feel smoother
- [ ] Sensory grounding increased

### ✓ Balance Right:
- [ ] Doesn't feel bloated
- [ ] Doesn't explain more
- [ ] Impact increased, not diluted
- [ ] Reads naturally
- [ ] Better than compressed version

## Common Questions

### "Won't expansion undo the refinement work?"

No, because depth expansion:
- Adds sensory/physical detail (not explanation)
- Maintains show-not-tell
- Doesn't reintroduce telling
- Strategic, not everywhere
- One detail, not catalogs

You're adding breathing room, not verbal fat.

### "Should I always refine then expand?"

No. Decision tree:

**Raw prose → Refined (700 words)**
- If feels perfect: Stop, done
- If feels skeletal: Expand depth
- If still too long: Second refinement pass

Many refined pieces need no expansion. Use when appropriate.

### "Can I expand more than 25%?"

Technically yes, but:
- >25% risks dilution
- Might indicate insufficient refinement first
- Better: Second targeted expansion than one >30% pass

Stay disciplined at 15-25% for best results.

### "What if expansion feels wrong?"

Selective restoration:
- Keep additions that work
- Restore original for additions that don't
- You're the final judge

The enriched version is a suggestion, not a decree.

## Use Cases by Content Type

### Fiction (Scenes, Stories):
**Best for:** Emotional peaks, character moments, key decisions
**Target:** 20-25% expansion for publication-quality richness

### Journal Entries:
**Best for:** Moments of insight, emotional pivots
**Target:** 15-20% expansion (voice preservation important)

### Essays:
**Best for:** Key arguments, examples, transitions
**Target:** 15-20% expansion (clarity + depth)

### Memoir:
**Best for:** Memory moments, sensory reconstruction
**Target:** 20-25% expansion (immersion critical)

## Success Metrics

A successful depth expansion delivers:

1. **15-25% growth** from refined input
2. **No quality loss** (all 10 Le Guin checks still pass)
3. **Better balance** (richer without bloat)
4. **Strategic additions** (3-7 key moments deepened)
5. **Maintained craft** (show-not-tell, body-emotion, weighted dialogue intact)

**Example results:**
- Input: 700 words refined, feels thin
- Output: 850 words enriched (+21%), ACCEPTABLE/STRONG quality
- Key moments: 5 areas deepened (emotional peaks, dialogue beats, transitions)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get refined prose** (use Refinement Pipeline if needed)
2. **Invoke Depth Expander** (EXPAND_DEPTH mode)
3. **Review enriched result** (verify quality + balance)
4. **Accept or adjust** (keep what works, restore what doesn't)
5. **Final quality check** (all principles maintained?)

---

**Remember:** Depth expansion is for prose that's already good and needs richness. If prose isn't refined yet, refine first.

Start with the Refinement Coordinator in EXPAND_DEPTH mode when ready.
