# Workflow: Iterative Development

Refine beats before prose generation, or cycle through multiple refinements.

---

## When to Use

- Complex ideas need beat refinement first
- Want control over structure before prose
- Multiple refinement passes needed
- Experimenting with different approaches

---

## Two Patterns

### Pattern A: Iterate on Beats
Refine beats before generating prose

### Pattern B: Iterate on Prose
Multiple refinement cycles

---

## Pattern A: Beat Iteration

```
Your Idea
    ↓
Idea Expander (beats v1)
    ↓
Your Feedback ("add more dialogue," "change ending")
    ↓
Revised Beats (v2)
    ↓
[Repeat if needed]
    ↓
Prose Generator (from final beats)
    ↓
Draft Prose
```

### When to Use
- Complex scenes with many possibilities
- Unsure about structure
- Want to see beats before committing
- Learning beat structure

### Process

1. **Generate initial beats**
2. **Review beats** - Do they match your vision?
3. **Give specific feedback:**
   - "Add confrontation in beat 4"
   - "Remove retrospective frame"
   - "More physical detail in beat 2"
4. **Revise beats**
5. **Repeat if needed** (max 3 iterations)
6. **Generate prose** from final beats

### Example

**Iteration 1:**
```
Beat 3: Character realizes mother never understood
```
Feedback: "Too tell-y, needs physical moment"

**Iteration 2:**
```
Beat 3: Mother turns away when character mentions father
```
Feedback: "Better! But needs dialogue"

**Iteration 3:**
```
Beat 3: "It was about Dad." / Mother's hands still.
She turns to the sink, back to character.
```
Feedback: "Perfect. Generate prose."

**Result:** Prose generated from refined beats

---

## Pattern B: Prose Iteration

```
Draft Prose (raw or generated)
    ↓
Prose Refiner (pass 1)
    ↓
Quality Reviewer (identifies issues)
    ↓
Prose Refiner (pass 2, targeted)
    ↓
Quality Reviewer (confirms improvement)
    ↓
[Optional: pass 3 if needed]
    ↓
Final Refined Prose
```

### When to Use
- First refinement leaves WEAK scores
- Important work needs excellence
- Specific issues to address
- Learning craft iteratively

### Process

1. **First refinement pass** - General application of principles
2. **Review scores** - What's WEAK/FAIL?
3. **Second pass** - Target specific issues:
   - "Focus on dialogue" (if dialogue scored WEAK)
   - "Ground all emotions physically" (if body-emotion WEAK)
   - "Simplify at peaks" (if precision WEAK)
4. **Re-review** - Confirm improvement
5. **Stop at 3 passes** (diminishing returns)

### Example

**Pass 1:**
- Input: 1,000 words raw
- Output: 750 words refined
- Scores: 7 ACCEPTABLE, 2 WEAK (dialogue, emotion)

**Pass 2 (targeted):**
- Focus: Dialogue and emotion grounding
- Output: 700 words
- Scores: 9 ACCEPTABLE, 1 STRONG

**Pass 3 (optional):**
- Minor polish
- Output: 680 words
- Scores: 8 ACCEPTABLE, 2 STRONG

**Result:** 68% of original length, strong quality

## Iteration Limits

**Beat Iteration:** Maximum 3
- Iteration 1: Initial structure
- Iteration 2: Refinements
- Iteration 3: Final tweaks
- After 3: Generate and revise prose instead

**Prose Iteration:** Maximum 3
- Pass 1: Major refinement (20-30% cut)
- Pass 2: Targeted fixes (10-15% more)
- Pass 3: Minor polish (5-10% more)
- After 3: Diminishing returns, stop

---

## When to Stop Iterating

**Stop if:**
- Quality scores are ACCEPTABLE+ across the board
- Changes become minimal (<5% between passes)
- You're tweaking for tweaking's sake
- You've hit iteration limit (3 passes)

**Continue if:**
- Critical FAIL scores remain
- Specific issues easily fixable
- Each pass shows clear improvement
- Haven't hit limit yet

---

## Advantages

✓ **Control** - Shape structure before prose
✓ **Quality** - Multiple passes reach excellence
✓ **Learning** - See incremental improvements
✓ **Flexibility** - Adapt as you go

---

## Disadvantages

✗ **Time** - More passes = more time
✗ **Overthinking** - Can iterate too much
✗ **Diminishing returns** - Pass 4+ rarely helps

---

## Tips

**For beat iteration:**
- Be specific in feedback
- Focus on structure, not prose quality
- Don't iterate forever (3 max)
- Remember: prose can be revised too

**For prose iteration:**
- First pass: Let it cut aggressively
- Second pass: Target specific weak scores
- Third pass: Only if really needed
- Study what changed each time
