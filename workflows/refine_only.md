# Workflow: Refinement Only

Polish existing prose without generation.

---

## When to Use

- You have written prose that needs refinement
- Raw draft needs Le Guin-level polish
- Journal entry needs tightening
- Quality check on your work

---

## Process

```
Your Prose (raw draft)
    ↓
Prose Refiner (applies Le Guin principles)
    ↓
Quality Reviewer (assesses against standard)
    ↓
Refined Prose + Review → You
```

**Time:** Single pass (or 2-3 for iterative improvement)
**Output:** Refined prose (~70-80% of original length) + Quality review

---

## Step by Step

### 1. Prepare Your Prose

Must be:
- Complete prose (sentences/paragraphs)
- Draft quality (not just notes)
- 300+ words typically

Can be:
- Journal entries
- Scene drafts
- Essays
- Memoir fragments
- Any prose writing

### 2. Use Refinement Coordinator

Mode: **FULL** (or let Master Orchestrator detect)

Provide:
```
## Input
[Your prose]

## Mode
FULL (Refine + Review)

## Optional Goals
- Tighten this
- Fix dialogue
- Reduce over-explanation
```

### 3. Receive Refined Prose

**Prose Refiner applies all 10 principles:**
- Show don't tell
- Body before emotion
- Weighted dialogue
- Precision under emotion
- Trust the reader
- Concrete over abstract
- Selection over catalog
- Structural variation
- Appropriate compression
- POV integrity

**Typical result:** 20-30% compression, stronger impact

### 4. Review Quality Assessment

**Quality Reviewer scores 10 checks:**
Each scored: FAIL / WEAK / ACCEPTABLE / STRONG

**Plus:**
- Specific passages that need work
- Le Guin examples for comparison
- Prioritized revision recommendations

### 5. Decide Next Steps

Based on scores:
- **Mostly ACCEPTABLE/STRONG** → Accept
- **Some WEAK** → Second refinement pass targeting issues
- **Multiple FAIL** → May need structural revision

## Example

**Input (1,000 words):**
```
I felt anxious as I stood there. I wondered if she understood
what I was trying to say. The kitchen was full of familiar
smells—coffee, bread, cinnamon, and bacon. I thought about
all the mornings we'd spent here together. It made me sad to
think this might be the last one...
```

**Problems:** Emotion labeling, thought-reporting, over-explanation

**Refined (650 words):**
```
I stood at the counter. Did she understand? The kitchen
smelled of coffee and bread. All those mornings. This
might be the last.
```

**Quality Review:** ACCEPTABLE (8/10 checks)

## When to Use Refinement Only

✓ You've written your own draft
✓ Journal entries need polish
✓ Essays need tightening
✓ Learning your craft weaknesses
✓ Quality check before publication

## Files You'll Receive

```
[name]_refined.md        # Polished prose
[name]_review.md         # Quality assessment
```

---

## Next Steps

**If scores are good (ACCEPTABLE+):**
- Accept refined prose
- Apply any minor tweaks suggested
- Use in your project

**If scores have WEAK areas:**
- Run second refinement pass
- Target specific issues
- Re-review to confirm improvement

**If scores have FAIL areas:**
- Check if structural (plot/pacing) not line-level
- May need manual revision
- Or targeted refinement on specific sections

---

## Tips

**For best results:**
- Provide complete drafts (not fragments)
- Let refinement cut aggressively (trust it)
- Study what changed (learn your patterns)
- Apply lessons to future writing

**Multiple passes:**
- First pass: Major tightening (30% reduction typical)
- Second pass: Targeted fixes (10-15% more)
- Third pass: Diminishing returns (stop here)
