# Le Guin-Inspired Prose Style Guide

**Quick reference for writing excellent literary prose**

## The 10 Principles

1. **Show, don't tell** - Cut thought-reporting, trust images and actions
2. **Body before emotion** - "His chest tightened" not "He felt anxious"
3. **Weighted dialogue** - Every line does multiple jobs, silence matters
4. **Simplify at intensity** - Shorter sentences when emotion peaks
5. **Trust the reader** - Show once clearly; don't explain metaphors
6. **Concrete over abstract** - Even ideas grounded in physical reality
7. **Select over catalog** - One vivid detail, not a list
8. **Vary structure** - Break repetitive patterns
9. **Compress wisely** - Cut fat, preserve muscle
10. **Let POV work** - Use distance to prevent self-explanation

## Quick Transformations

### Eliminate Thought-Reporting
- ✗ "He wondered if the ships would return."
- ✓ "Would the ships return?"

### Ground Emotion in Body
- ✗ "I felt anxious and trapped."
- ✓ "My chest tightened. The room was too small."

### Weight Your Dialogue
- ✗ "Yes." "I don't know." "Maybe."
- ✓ Every line reveals character, advances situation, implies relationship

### Simplify at Peaks
- ✗ "As he stood watching the smoke rise in beautiful spiraling patterns..."
- ✓ "Smoke rose. Thin threads climbing."

### Cut the Explanation
- ✗ "Her hands moved constantly, representing her tireless devotion..."
- ✓ "Her hands, always moving."

### One Detail, Not Five
- ✗ "The room smelled of bread, coffee, bacon, cinnamon, and smoke."
- ✓ "The room smelled of bread and smoke."

## Common Fixes

### Over-Explanation → Trust
**BEFORE:**
> "I did not know that love could look like this: repetition without complaint, presence without announcement, the steady tending of small necessary things."

**AFTER:**
> "Her hands, always moving."

### Retrospective → Cut or Minimize
**BEFORE:** "I did not know, then..." × 5

**AFTER:** Use once maximum, or eliminate entirely

### Generic Dialogue → Specific
**BEFORE:**
> "Do you want to go?"
> "I don't know. Maybe."

**AFTER:**
> "Do you want to go?"
> She counted the ships. "How many leave each year?"

### Catalog → Selection
**BEFORE:**
> "The kitchen had the smell of fresh bread, coffee, bacon, cinnamon rolls, butter, and fireplace smoke."

**AFTER:**
> "The kitchen smelled of bread and smoke."

## Le Guin Examples to Study

### Action Reveals Character
> "He grew wild, a thriving weed, a tall, quick boy, loud and proud and full of temper." (Earthsea)

Not told he's wild—shown through what he IS.

### Physical Sensation Over Emotion Label
> "There was a singing in his ears which was not the orchestra but the noise that came when you kept yourself from crying." (Dispossessed)

Body reveals emotional state.

### Direct Questions Instead of Thought-Reporting
> "Where were they going?" (Earthsea)

NOT: "He wondered where they were going."

### Dialogue Weighted and Specific
> "'Mine sun!'" (Dispossessed)

Three syllables that reveal character, conflict, and philosophy.

### Simplification at Crisis
> "'I've hidden us all,' Duny said, sullenly, for his head hurt from his father's blow, and the working of the doubled incantation had drained his strength." (Earthsea)

Short, direct, physical. No decoration during crisis.

### Concrete Philosophy
> "'Nothing is yours. It is to use. It is to share.'" (Dispossessed)

Entire political system in one exchange between toddler and matron.

## Structure Patterns

### Time Through White Space
Not: "Over the next three years, he learned..."

Instead: Show moment at age 7 → [break] → show moment at age 10

### Fragments Represent Phases
Earthsea chapter 1:
- Age 7: Goat spell incident
- Ages 7-12: Learning from witch (compressed to key moments)
- Age 12-13: Karg battle
- Age 13: Naming ceremony

Each section = one vivid scene representing years.

### Varied Openings
Don't start every section the same way. Le Guin constantly varies:
- Physical description
- Dialogue
- Action
- Temporal marker
- Philosophical statement

## Quality Tests

### Read Aloud
- Does it breathe?
- Is there rhythm?
- Do short sentences land with weight?

### Distance Check
- Am I WATCHING the character or HEARING their self-analysis?
- Would a camera capture this?

### Trust Test
- Have I explained what the image shows?
- Have I told readers what to feel?
- Have I stated what they can infer?

### Compression Check
- Is every word earning its place?
- Could this be half as long with twice the impact?

## What Le Guin Would Cut

- Explanations of emotion
- Retrospective commentary (except minimally)
- Thought-reporting ("he wondered," "he thought," "he realized")
- Generic dialogue
- Redundant details
- Explained metaphors
- Spelled-out time transitions

## What Le Guin Would Keep

- Physical sensation
- Direct questions/observations
- Weighted, specific dialogue
- One vivid detail
- Action that implies
- Silence and white space
- Distance between narrator and character

## When in Doubt

**Ask:** What would Le Guin cut?

Then cut it.
