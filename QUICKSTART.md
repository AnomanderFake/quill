# Quick Start Guide

Get your prose refined in 3 steps.

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Text

Save your writing as a text file, or have it ready to paste.

**Works with:**
- Novel scenes
- Short stories
- Essays
- Journal entries
- Memoir fragments
- Any prose writing

**Ideal length for first try:** 500-2000 words

---

## Step 2: Use the Pipeline Coordinator

Open `agents/pipeline_coordinator.md` and follow the agent's instructions.

**Provide:**
- Your text
- Pipeline mode (recommend: FULL for first time)
- Optional: Context, goals, constraints

**Example input:**

```
## Text to Process
[Your 1,000-word draft scene]

## Pipeline Mode
FULL

## Goals
Tighten this, reduce over-explanation, sharpen dialogue
```

---

## Step 3: Review Results

You'll receive:

1. **Refined text** - Typically 20-30% shorter, stronger
2. **Quality review** - 10 scores + specific feedback
3. **Statistics** - Word counts, what changed, recommendations

**Then decide:**
- ✓ **Accept it** - If scores are ACCEPTABLE/STRONG
- ✓ **Second pass** - If scores are WEAK with clear issues
- ✓ **Manual revision** - If it needs structural work

## The 10 Principles (Cheat Sheet)

What the pipeline applies to your prose:

1. **Show, don't tell** - Cut "he felt" and "he wondered"
2. **Body before emotion** - "Chest tightened" not "felt anxious"
3. **Weighted dialogue** - Every line does multiple jobs
4. **Simplify at intensity** - Shorter sentences at emotional peaks
5. **Trust the reader** - Don't explain your metaphors
6. **Concrete over abstract** - Things, not concepts
7. **Select, don't catalog** - One detail, not five
8. **Vary structure** - Break repetitive patterns
9. **Compress wisely** - Cut fat, keep muscle
10. **Use POV** - Distance prevents self-explanation

## What to Expect

### First Time Through

**Your 1,000-word draft:**
- Becomes ~700 words
- Thought-reporting removed
- Emotions grounded in body
- Dialogue sharpened
- Explanations cut

**Quality Review says:**
- Some scores ACCEPTABLE
- Some scores WEAK
- Specific issues identified
- Le Guin examples provided

### Second Pass (Optional)

**Target specific issues:**
- Focus on the WEAK scores
- Follow review recommendations
- Run refined text through again

**Result:**
- Mostly ACCEPTABLE/STRONG
- Meets literary quality standard
- Ready for final polish

## Common First-Time Results

### "It cut so much! Did I lose important stuff?"

Probably not. The pipeline cuts:
- Over-explanation
- Redundant details
- Thought-reporting
- Emotion labeling
- Self-analysis

It keeps:
- Key images
- Emotional moments (now grounded physically)
- Character voice
- Essential information

**Test:** Does the refined version still convey what you meant? Usually yes, with more impact.

### "Some cuts feel wrong."

You're the final judge. Restore anything essential. But first ask:
- Am I attached to the explanation, or the core moment?
- Does the image work without the scaffolding?
- Am I trusting the reader enough?

### "The quality review seems harsh."

It's specific, not mean. Every WEAK or FAIL comes with:
- Exact passage cited
- Why it's a problem
- Le Guin example showing better way
- How to fix it

Use it as a learning tool, not a judgment.

## Learning from the Process

After your first few runs, you'll notice patterns:

**Common issues:**
- You over-explain emotions (we all do)
- Your dialogue is generic (fixable)
- You tell instead of show (learnable)
- You use too many details (select better)

**The pipeline teaches you:**
- What strong prose looks like (Le Guin examples)
- How to ground emotion in body
- How to trust your reader
- How to compress without losing power

After 5-10 runs, you'll start writing refined prose naturally.

## Examples

### Before Pipeline
> "I felt anxious as I stood there. I wondered if she understood what I was trying to say. The kitchen was full of familiar smells—coffee, bread, cinnamon, and bacon. I thought about all the mornings we'd spent here together. It made me sad to think this might be the last one."

**Problems:** Emotion labeling, thought-reporting, too many details, over-explanation

### After Pipeline
> "I stood at the counter. Did she understand? The kitchen smelled of coffee and bread. All those mornings. This might be the last."

**Improvements:** Physical presence, direct question, selected details, trust the sadness to emerge

## Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Start with rough drafts** - More dramatic improvement
2. **Read the Le Guin examples** - Calibrate your standard
3. **Study the review feedback** - Learn from your patterns
4. **Run important pieces twice** - First pass + targeted second pass
5. **Don't accept blindly** - You're the final arbiter

### To Learn Faster

1. **Compare before/after** - What got cut? Why?
2. **Study the Le Guin examples cited** - How does she handle similar moments?
3. **Track your scores** - Are certain checks always WEAK? Focus there.
4. **Apply lessons to new writing** - Internalize the principles

## Next Steps

1. Read `style_guide.md` (5 minutes)
2. Read one Le Guin example in `resources/` (30 minutes)
3. Prepare a 500-1000 word piece
4. Run it through the pipeline
5. Study results
6. Try again with refinement focus

## Files You Need

- `agents/pipeline_coordinator.md` - Orchestrates the workflow
- `agents/prose_refiner.md` - Does the refinement
- `agents/quality_reviewer.md` - Assesses the quality
- `style_guide.md` - Quick reference
- `resources/examples_*` - Le Guin benchmarks

## That's It

The pipeline is a tool for learning and refinement. Use it, experiment, adapt it.

The goal isn't to write like Le Guin. It's to write with her level of craft.

Start with `example_input.txt` to see formatting, or dive right in with your own text.
