Relevance at work

The center of the mass for the BMX effort leans very heavily towards NY. I feel a sense of ownership for the project, have, for the past week and a half of working on it. And suddenly, i have this realization. Majorly I feel like I am not driving this project, and that I am more of a passerby, and that makes me sad, and a bit hopeless. One more year of whiling my life away for concerns and work not my own? Nevertheless, there is work in foront of me, and I need to do it, and in doing so, build my own learning i can leverage to leave for the next thing. I need to prepare myself to get better, and the work this year is the foundation to do doing that. I need to finish the work on the Algo side and move on again to the BMX. On the business side, I need to understand the in-and-outs of. block reporting and matching mechangincs, and the post-trade aspects of it.
