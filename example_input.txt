=== EXAMPLE INPUT FOR QUILL PIPELINE ===

Below is an example of how to format your input for the pipeline.
You can use this template, or just paste your raw text directly.

===================================

## Text to Process

[Paste your writing here. Can be a scene, essay, journal entry, etc.]

Example:

I was thinking about my childhood yesterday. I felt a strange mixture of nostalgia and sadness. I wondered if everyone feels this way when they remember the past. My grandmother's house was special to me. It had a particular smell—a combination of lavender, old books, and something I couldn't quite identify. When I think about her now, I realize that she was always busy doing something. She represented constancy to me. I didn't know then how much I would miss those summer afternoons.

===================================

## Pipeline Mode

[Choose one: FULL / REFINE_ONLY / REVIEW_ONLY / ITERATIVE]

FULL

===================================

## Context (Optional)

[What is this piece? Scene from a novel, personal essay, journal entry, etc.]

This is a fragment from a personal essay about memory and place.

===================================

## Goals (Optional)

[What do you want to achieve? Tighten prose? Sharpen dialogue? Reduce over-explanation?]

This feels over-explained and tell-y. I want it to be more showing, more physical, less self-analyzing.

===================================

## Constraints (Optional)

[Anything to preserve? Target length? Specific elements that must stay?]

Keep the grandmother and the house. The lavender detail matters.

===================================

That's it! The pipeline will:
1. Refine the prose using Le Guin principles
2. Review it against quality standards
3. Return refined text + detailed feedback

Expected outcome for the example above:
- Much shorter (probably 50% reduction)
- Physical details instead of emotion labels
- No thought-reporting ("I wondered if...")
- No self-analysis ("she represented constancy")
- Trust the images to carry the meaning
