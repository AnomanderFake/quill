# Technique: Show, Don't Tell

## The Principle

**Cut thought-reporting. Trust images and actions.**

The weakest prose tells readers what characters think, feel, wonder, realize. Strong prose shows through:
- Sensory detail
- Physical action
- Direct questions (not "he wondered if")
- Concrete observation

This is the foundation of Le Guin's compression. Every time you cut "he felt" or "she wondered," you remove a layer between reader and story.

## Examples from Earthsea

### Example 1: Internal Conflict Through Physical Detail

> "He looked down at his thin arms, wet with cold fogdew, and raged at his weakness, for he knew his strength. There was power in him, if he knew how to use it..."

**Why it works:**
- Physical detail (thin arms, cold fogdew) before emotion
- "Raged" is active, physical, not "felt angry"
- The contradiction (weakness/strength) shown through physical reality + internal knowledge
- No meta-commentary explaining his conflict

**What Le Guin avoided:**
- "He felt frustrated that his body was too weak to fight even though he knew he had magical power inside him."

### Example 2: Childhood Wildness Shown, Not Named

> "He grew wild, a thriving weed, a tall, quick boy, loud and proud and full of temper."

**Why it works:**
- "Grew wild" = metaphor that shows
- Stack of physical descriptors: tall, quick, loud, proud
- "Full of temper" is concrete trait, not psychologizing
- No explanation needed - we SEE the boy

**What Le Guin avoided:**
- "Duny had a difficult childhood and became an unruly child as a result."

### Example 3: Fear Through Observation, Not Reporting

> "All at once he felt afraid of their thick, ridged horns and their strange eyes and their strange silence."

**Note:** This breaks the rule slightly ("felt afraid") but immediately grounds it in three concrete observations: horns, eyes, silence. The physical details do the work; "felt afraid" is almost redundant.

Compare to pure showing in the next line:
> "He tried to get free of them and to run away."

Action = fear made visible.

### Example 4: Curiosity Through Action

> "When he found that the wild falcons stooped down to him from the wind when he summoned them by name, lighting with a thunder of wings on his wrist like the hunting-birds of a prince, then he hungered to know more such names and came to his aunt begging to learn..."

**Why it works:**
- "Hungered" = physical verb for intellectual desire
- "Came begging" = action showing motivation
- NOT: "He was very curious and wanted to learn more magic."
- The consequence (seeking more knowledge) proves the desire

### Example 5: Desperation and Determination

> "It rankled at his heart that he should die, spitted on a Kargish lance, while still a boy: that he should go into the dark land without ever having known his own name, his true name as a man."

**Why it works:**
- "Rankled at his heart" = emotion located physically
- Specific image: "spitted on a Kargish lance"
- The stakes are concrete: dying unnamed
- NOT: "He felt desperate and determined to survive."

### Example 6: Exhaustion Without Telling

> "'I've hidden us all,' Duny said, sullenly, for his head hurt from his father's blow, and the working of the doubled incantation had drained his strength."

**Why it works:**
- "Sullenly" = manner of speech (observable)
- Physical causes given: head hurt, strength drained
- Effect shown through dialogue tone
- We understand exhaustion without being told "he was exhausted"

## Examples from Dispossessed

### Example 7: Near-Crying Without Naming It

> "There was a singing in his ears which was not the orchestra but the noise that came when you kept yourself from crying; he had observed this singing noise several times before."

**Why it works:**
- Incredibly precise physical observation
- The analysis is Shevek's, in the moment, scientific
- Never says "he wanted to cry" or "he felt sad"
- The clinical observation IS the emotional content

**This is Le Guin's genius:** Making observation itself the emotion.

### Example 8: Rage Through Physical Change

> "The knobby one's blank rapture gave place at once to a scowl of rage."

**Why it works:**
- "Blank rapture" → "scowl of rage" = transformation shown
- Both states are visible, observable
- "Gave place" = precise description of change
- NOT: "The baby suddenly felt very angry."

### Example 9: Humiliation Through Physical Response

> "His face was a glare of sunlight and anger."

**Why it works:**
- External observation (what camera would see)
- Sunlight + anger fused in single image
- Physical and emotional merged
- One line; enormous impact

### Example 10: Shame/Discomfort Through Sensation

> "He felt clever, he felt a sense of power, in not replying. Yet when Tirin replied coolly that he must have joined another group for the day, Shevek was shocked by the lie. His sense of secret power suddenly made him uncomfortable: his legs itched, his ears felt hot."

**Why it works:**
- Abstract feeling (clever, powerful) immediately undercut
- "Shocked" is active response, then—
- Physical manifestations: legs itch, ears hot
- These precise sensations ARE shame/discomfort
- NOT: "He felt ashamed and uncomfortable."

### Example 11: Attraction Without Romance Language

> "At first her muscular beauty had rather awed him, but now he was strong enough to desire her."

**Why it works:**
- Physical change in Shevek (grew stronger) enables emotional change
- "Awed" and "desire" are concrete states, not vague feelings
- Physical reality (his strength) determines emotional reality
- Skips all the thought-reporting of attraction

### Example 12: Despair Through Physical Presence

> "He sat with his hands between his knees, his head bowed, a long boy, rawboned, disconsolate, unfinished."

**Why it works:**
- Pure physical description
- "Disconsolate" is the only emotional word
- The posture shows everything: defeat, youth, vulnerability
- "Unfinished" = brilliant - physical and emotional simultaneously

### Example 13: Discovery Through Direct Question

> "'What book? Is there one here?'"

**Instead of:** "Shevek wondered if there was a book about the paradox in the library."

**Why it works:**
- Direct speech = immediate
- Shows eagerness, intellectual hunger
- Reader experiences the question with Shevek
- No narrative distance

### Example 14: Love Through Action Pattern

> "'I'll never know anyone like you again, Shev. I never will forget you.'"

**Why it works:**
- Gimar doesn't say "I love you" or "you're special"
- Future permanence = weight of feeling
- Specificity: *you*, not "someone like you"
- The action (remembering forever) proves the feeling

### Example 15: Prison Experiment - Horror Through Physical Detail

> "He was in terrible pain, mostly from his hands. I don't think he knew the rest of his body was all charred, he felt it mostly in his hands. You couldn't touch him to comfort him, the skin and flesh would come away at your touch, and he'd scream."

**Why it works:**
- Unflinching physical detail
- Specific: hands, not "body"
- Action that can't be taken: "couldn't touch"
- Consequence: skin comes away, scream
- The horror shown, not told
- NOT: "It was a horrible, traumatic experience."

## The Narrator Exception: Voiced Telling

**Show-don't-tell is a scalpel, not a machete.**

Le Guin's craft is not invisible. The storyteller is present. There is a crucial difference between *dead telling* and *voiced telling*, and applying this principle mechanically will kill the narrator's voice.

### Voiced Telling (KEEP)

The narrator stepping in with perspective, gathering threads, placing a moment in the larger story:

> "This was Duny's first step on the way he was to follow all his life, the way of magery, the way that led him at last to hunt a shadow over land and sea to the lightless coasts of death's kingdom." (Earthsea)

This is pure telling. It's also one of the best lines in the chapter. The narrator knows the whole story and speaks from that knowledge. This adds something the images cannot: scope, warmth, the sense of a story being told.

> "It was all easy now, so easy, and lovely, out in the warm dust, in the starlight." (Dispossessed)

Narrator voice, not image. But it earns its place through rhythm and feeling.

### Dead Telling (CUT)

The narrator explaining what images already show, without adding perspective or voice:

- "He had been waiting for this." (After a scene already showing anticipation)
- "It was a good life." (After pages of scenes showing a good life)
- "He seemed content with that." (After showing contentment through action)

### The Test

Ask: **Does this telling add something the scenes cannot?**

- Perspective across time → Keep. ("Had known it, maybe, since he was seven...")
- The narrator's warmth or irony → Keep. ("So he came by the name that he kept in later life...")
- Explaining what the reader already sees → Cut. ("He'd been waiting for this.")
- Labeling an emotion the body already showed → Cut. ("He felt sad.")

The narrator is a storyteller, not a tour guide pointing at what's already visible.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Thought-Reporting
- "He wondered if..."
- "She realized that..."
- "He thought about..."
- "She believed..."

### ❌ Emotion Labels Without Physical Anchor
- "He felt anxious."
- "She was happy."
- "They were scared."

### ❌ Explaining What You've Shown
After showing anger through action, adding: "He was furious."

### ❌ Summarizing Inner Life
- "He had mixed feelings about..."
- "She didn't know what to think..."
- "He was confused..."

## Quick Transformations

### Transform #1: Wonder → Question
- **Instead of:** "He wondered if the ships would return."
- **Write:** "Would the ships return?"

### Transform #2: Realization → Action
- **Instead of:** "She realized he was lying."
- **Write:** "His eyes slid left. She stood up."

### Transform #3: Feeling → Sensation
- **Instead of:** "I felt anxious."
- **Write:** "My chest tightened."

### Transform #4: Emotional State → Physical Evidence
- **Instead of:** "He was devastated."
- **Write:** "He sat with his hands between his knees, his head bowed."

### Transform #5: Abstract → Concrete
- **Instead of:** "The village was in danger."
- **Write:** "Smoke darkened the eastern sky."

## The Test

**Read your paragraph aloud. Count these words:**
- felt
- thought
- wondered
- realized
- knew
- believed

**If you count more than one per 200 words, revise.**

Ask: What would a camera see? What would a body feel?

Replace thought-reporting with:
- Direct questions
- Physical sensations
- Observable actions
- Concrete details

## Remember

Le Guin doesn't avoid interiority. She makes interiority *physical* and *observable*.

The reader still knows what Ged feels, but they know through his thin arms in the fog, his rage at weakness, his hunger for knowledge.

The reader still knows what Shevek feels, but they know through the singing in his ears, his itching legs, his hands between his knees.

**And Le Guin doesn't avoid telling.** She tells with voice, with the warmth of a storyteller who knows the whole story. What she avoids is *dead* telling: explaining what the images already show, labeling what the body already reveals.

The narrator is welcome. The tour guide is not.

**Show the body. Trust the reader. Let the narrator speak when only the narrator can.**
